# Clojure

This folder contains my solution to some Clojure katas.

Clojure is a fun language. It provides a good functional syntax. The reference I use most frequently during coding is [the Clojure API cheatsheet](https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet).

The most irritating part of Clojure is that it doesn't offer the tuple type. I guess this is due to the limitation of JVM. However, even C# [supported tuples in C# 7.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7#tuples). I think JVM should follow the step.
